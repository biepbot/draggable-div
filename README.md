# draggable-div

A div that knows how to drag! Example styling included.

## How to use

Embed the script in your page as a module:

```html
<script type="module" src="./js/draggable_div.mjs"></script>
```

This will register itself in the custom component registy, meaning you can then on your page refer to the new tag name `draggable-div`
